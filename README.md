5. Use GEN AI to build network designs.

## Improvements

1. Make is easier to differentiate between networks in the diagram.
2. Fix the missing connections.
3. Ports per server. The server has n ports per config. Round robin connections ordered by number leaf-1, leaf-2....
4. Drive connections by servers.
5. See where the server is plugged in. Server 1 port one is connected to leaf 1 port 1.
6. Split the networks better.
7. Leafs need to show connections from server.
8. Make the dialogs bigger.
9. Port level
